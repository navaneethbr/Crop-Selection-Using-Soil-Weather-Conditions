# Crop-Selection-Using-Soil-Weather-Conditions
<p> Crop production is influenced by agro-climatic input characteristics such as soil texture, rainfall, and temperature. Agriculture input characteristics differ from place to region, and gathering such data over broad swaths of land is difficult. The extensive datasets gathered can be utilised to make large-scale crop predictions. Because of the nature of the issues, new machine learning approaches for cultivating arable land and making the most of limited land resources are required.<p>
<p> I have applied few data pre-processing techniques namely features transformation, features scaling, checking for class imbalance, feature extraction and I have uesd label en-coding for the target label <p>
<p> Machine learning models used<p>
  <ul>
  <li>KNN Classifier for Crop prediction.</li>
  <li>Classification using Support Vector Classifer (SVC)</li>
  <li>Classifying using decision tree</li>
   <li>Classification using Random Forest</li>
  </ul>
